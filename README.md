# melody.ai
This is a simple interactive webpage created using the **Streamlit library** in Python
<p>
The webpage contains animations imported with the help of the Lottie Files.
It also takes inputs from the user and there is custom theme creation, done using the .config.toml file.

The .json files are the animations uploaded from the local drive, alternatively, you can also upload 
the Lottie file URL.

We also have MP3 player, included in it using streamlit.audio
